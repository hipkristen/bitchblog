                      Boom. I got a ticket to go see BILL CLINTON get intereviewed by JON STEWART in one of the last tapings of The Daily Show! Easily one of my top coolest NYC experiences. AND the first president I've seen in person.

                      I worked more on my <a href = "Game/index.html" class = "inTextLink">GAME</a> today, but as you can see I didn't get it all worked out just yet. The idea is going to be to try to get the pink box through the other divs and accross some finish line-esq thing without hitting them.

                It's been a few days since I've written, but that doesn't mean I haven't been busy learning! 
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm in the very early stages of trying to build out a simple javascript / jquery game where I would like a dot I made to avoid the other divs. It's a work in progress, of course -- but <a href = "Game.index.html" class = "inTextLink">here's where I'm at</a> after ~3 hours of trying at this! Don't judge too harsh, please!
              </p>
            <p>
              In terms of learning, I have gone through most of the CodeAcademy javascript tutorial again to reinforce concepts. Then I went to Lynda and found a super great video / interactive javacscript essentials course that's helped give me a more holistic view of javascript interactivity, as well as some great tips / lessons that weren't directly covered, so much as implied by CodeAcademy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, I had a lovely picnic in the park with my friends this weekend, as you can see! Aren't they the cutest?!

               		It's been a few days and I've been uber busy, but making an effort to keep posts flowing - even though I've mostly been in HTML & CSS lately. I'm thinking before I'm ready to move on to another language, I'll probably focus on learning javascript better by going through the W3 schools tutorial and then back to the CodeAcademy one perhaps. 
               	</p>
                	<p>
                		There are so many resources out there it can definitely start to feel overwhelming. Especially since I currently hold a job as an accounant at a young company where I easily work 60+ hours per week on average. I'm a CPA, it's ok to be jealous, though I am pretty proud that I'm certified.
               	</p>
               	<p>
               		These are some things I did this week while not working...

               		I rode in a cab home from a date, went to a work pasta party that was mostly dev team members and I soaked up their programming energy. Plus they made homemade pasta plus they're just really nice people that I'm excited to be friends with.
               	</p>
               	<p>
               		Today I went to yoga for the first time in way too long and I know I need to bring that back into my life as a regular thing! I missed it more than I knew!
               	</p>
               	<p>
               		Oh - in addition to the headers, footers & menus I'd like to add a covering page that is like pink with white text and brackets around my name looking cool. Then you can click on it and you arrive here at my home base. Yes I think I can do that. So many goals. Excited to get going on them and for this blog and my knowledge base to evolve.
               	</p>
               	<p>
                  	What I'm really passionate about is database management though, so I'm hoping once I start learning those skills I'll be able to come up with a creative way to incorporate them either here or to find another medium in which to practice (not just a CodeAcademy sandbox, but an actual project).
               	</p>
               	<p>
               		I'm obviously getting WAY ahead of myself. But whatever, it's fun to be so excited!

                  		My parents are here visiting this weekend me from my sweet home of Syracuse, NY. We've meandered the streets of Greenpoint & the West Village (- where I abide and work, respectively -), eaten lots, saw the musical Beautiful, and now we're going to head to brunch in just moments.
                  	</p>
                   	<p>
                   		I'm glad to see them and hope to eventually be able to show them this blog tracking my development as a developer. Not quite even close to ready to go public with that just yet, though.
                  	</p>
                  	<p>
                  		I did get a bit of time this morning to work on site stuff though. Mostly formatting and completing the jQuery section of CodeAcademy.
                  	</p>
                  	<p>
                  		I'm hoping to be able to incorporate some cool items I learned in that to develop menus on this site & different sections: i.e.: About Me, Something else & Something Else I haven't thought of yet.
                  	</p>
                  	<p>
                  		Also, headers and footers would be a good thing to get to - must get on that as well and figure out how to do more complex things like add a link to twitter (I think that's a further out goal for me).

                  		Hey gang. Only put in 1.5 hours tonight because I just came home (a bit buzzed) from this event my current company had with facebook. The facebook offices were cool mostly for the free food, which was a great perk. It made me excited to be around so many tech people and then I wanted to go home and develop this site and play on code academy more, and now here I am - home and too buzzed to do much.

                  	<p>
                  		However, I did improve the general layout, if I do say so myself. And I added a new selfie #letmejustkillmyselfbeforeitakeanotherselfie.

      					Well, after three full hours and a magical 18 more minutes of effort - I finally got my photos to align. I'm guessing this can't happen in css after some pretty intense googling with background image & local file requirements.
      				</p>

      				<p>
      					Some background: I'm 29 years old. One month ago, when I was still 28, I made the decision that I am goign to learn to code after knowing next to nothing about it. I still don't understand what the cloud is or how it works, but I'm learning at html, css, javascript & jquery a la code academy. Now I'm playing with github and am excited to track my progress on this site there.
      				</p>

      				<p>
      					<a href = "Website/index.html" class = "inTextLink">Here</a> is a link to the first site I built (at 12 days into learning this people, cut me a break). I was soo proud of it at the time, but I have a feeling I'm going to be gravely embarassed by it in the future ha.
      				</p>

      				<p>
      					I'm working with my friend to build a site together and coordinate that build with GitHub, so I thought why not blog my way through this process as well. Especially since GitHub lets me save each iteration of my process, I think it could be really cool to look back on - like a diary of code.
      				</p>

      				<p>
      					I want the form, structure & content on this platform to evolove as my coding knowledge does. I also want provide a candid account of what the path from zero computer knowledge to fullstack developer looks like (- confidence, bitches -) but without leaving out any of the sticky or hard stuff to try to make myself sound a particular breed of smart or knowledgable.
      				</p>
      				<p>
      					Goals for next time: map out how these blog posts should flow and be archived so they're not just sitting here in a blob, but can be actually organized by date and key accomplishments.
      				</p> 

      				<p>
      					<ul><div class = "ulTitle">These are things I learned today: </div>
      						<li>you can't link html to local image files</li>
      						<li>background images aren't easy - perhaps even possible? - to put in a line</li>
      						<li>css can turn your normal elements in html into table elements without you having to set them up that way in html first! so cool!</li>
      						<li>if I use 'text-align: center' in css on a container, the images (or text) inside that container becomes centered within that on the page</li>
      					</ul>
      				</p>

      				<p>
      					This is going to be a long road, and I'm so excited to be here at the start! Wish me luck!!
      				</p>

      				<p>
      					PS: I am aware this looks like shit now - it's a work in progress, people. Give me some time here - I wasted 3 hours on image alignment! Eek! I'm sure that won't be the last such instance, either!
