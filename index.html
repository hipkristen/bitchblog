               <p> Hey gang. Only put in 1.5 hours tonight because I just came home (a bit buzzed) from this event my current company had with facebook. The facebook offices were cool mostly for the free food, which was a great perk. It made me excited to be around so many tech people and then I wanted to go home and develop this site and play on code academy more, and now here I am - home and too buzzed to do much.
               </p>

               <p>
               However, I did improve the general layout, if I do say so myself. And I added a new selfie #letmejustkillmyselfbeforeitakeanotherselfie.

               XO more to follow.

		Well, after three full hours and a magical 18 more minutes of effort - I finally got my photos to align. I'm guessing this can't happen in css after some pretty intense googling with background image & local file requirements.
		</p>
		<p>
		Some background: I'm 29 years old. One month ago, when I was still 28, I made the decision that I am goign to learn to code after knowing next to nothing about it. I still don't understand what the cloud is or how it works, but I'm learning at html, css, javascript & jquery a la code academy. Now I'm playing with github and am excited to track my progress on this site there.
		</p>
		<p>
		I want the form, structure & content on this platform to evolove as my coding knowledge does. I also want provide a candid account of what the path from zero computer knowledge to fullstack developer looks like (- confidence, bitches -) but without leaving out any of the sticky or hard stuff to try to make myself sound a particular breed of smart or knowledgable.
		</p>
		<p>
		Goals for next time: map out how these blog posts should flow and be archived so they're not just sitting here in a blob, but can be actually organized by date and key accomplishments.
		</p> 

		These are things I learned today:
		<ul>
			<li>you can't link html to local image files</li>
			<li>background images aren't easy - perhaps even possible? - to put in a line</li>
			<li>css can turn your normal elements in html into table elements without you having to set them up that way in html first! so cool!</li>
			<li>if I use 'text-align: center' in css on a container, the images (or text) inside that container becomes centered within that on the page</li>
		</ul>

		This is going to be a long road, and I'm so excited to be here at the start! Wish me luck!!

		PS: I am aware this looks like shit now - it's a work in progress, people. Give me some time here - I wasted 3 hours on image alignment! Eek! I'm sure that won't be the last such instance, either!
