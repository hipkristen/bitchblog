        	<a href = "Website/index.html" class = "inTextLink">Web of Lies</a> was my first idea for an interactive site to test out some CodeAcademy lessons outside of the sandbox they provide. Just a cheecky little "game" meant to suggest and price out some white(ish) to extreme(ish) lies for common scenerios.

        	<a href ="../../LifeSite/home.html" class = "inTextLink">Life Site</a> is a goofy colaborative project that my friend in California and I made up as a platform to practice things as we learn them. I did the main screen & love page. I'm meant to do family as well, but I'm not seeing tons of learning potential in building this out further, so holding on putting more energy into it until further notice. <em>Warning:</em> there are many annoying alerts in this one.

        		<a href = "Game/index.html" class = "inTextLink">This simple game</a> that is still in process. The goal that I intend to effect is to get the pink box through the other moving boxes and past a finish line of sorts without hitting any of them.
