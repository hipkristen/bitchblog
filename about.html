            Q If you had to live in just one place – without ever leaving – where would it be?
        </p>    
        <p class = "A">
            A This question makes me claustrophobic, but I realize I have to answer it anyway. I guess I’d stay here New York. The diverse and dynamic cityscape would help me to feel less trapped than I actually am in the confines of this scenario. Also, whenever I come back to New York after a trip, I feel relieved to be here in this giant pile of garbage and magic. It’s comfortable and crazy and it’s home.
        </p>


        <p class = "Q">
            Q Do you prefer animals to people?
        </p>
        <p class = "A">
            A I love animals from afar and people from up close. 
            I find zoos disturbing and pets to be too much work, but I dream of safaris and deep-sea dives to witness animals existing in their natural habitats. I could watch Planet Earth for days and am fascinated by the balance that exists in the unhampered-with animal world. I think they know something I don’t.
        </p>
        <p>
            People are complicated and weird, and that’s probably why I relate to and prefer them. When it comes down to it, I’d rather spend a free day hanging out with a person than a puppy if given the choice. 
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q Are you cruel?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A I am not cruel, but that’s because I have actively decided not to be. I am dark, insensitive and selfish by design. My sometimes sociopathic thoughts are simultanitously terrifying, intruiging and delightful to digest.
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q Do you have many friends?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A I do; though I only have a few close friends and true confidants. Sometimes I forget how lucky I am to have those amazing few in my life. They’ve seen me at some pretty low times and know the depths of my crazy, yet still show me love and respect and understanding. I hope they think I do well to reciprocate that. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of these top-tier loved ones, sadly, live far away from New York. In my day-to-day, I spend my time with other interesting, charming and worthwhile friends here in town. I’m pretty damned lucky and answering this question helped remind me of that.
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q Are you often disappointed by a friend?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A Disappointment can only come when you set expectations above what a friend will deliver. I keep company with a kind and dependable bunch that I don’t expect too much or too little from; I am rarely, if ever, let down. My few closest friends could and would never disappoint me.
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q Are you a truthful person?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A When I was younger, like high school or early college, I used to lie all the time to make myself sound more interesting. I’d overhear strangers telling stories and I’d tweak the details to fit my life and take them for my own. After a while of doing this, it started to get confusing as to whom I told what to. I would often have delicately dance out of corners I’d backed myself into: an exhausting practice. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I don’t remember if anything in particular prompted it or when the change took place, but one day I just stopped lying and that was that. Now the only time I lie is if I’m on a bad date and I know I never want to see that person again. That is when I let my old habit run wild and I really have fun with it. It makes for great sport. See what I mean about my insensitive and selfish nature?
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q How do you occupy your spare time?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A In the winter, I like to lie in bed and read for hours. I also like to knit or clean my apartment while listening to NPR. In summer, I like to picnic at the park with friends or go to the beach. In any season, I love to explore, adventure, exercise and laugh.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ew. This answer sounds like a lame online dating profile response. I need to amp it up if I ever want to get any messages on Tinder, eh?!
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q What are you most proud of?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A I am most proud of my fiercely independent nature. A close second is that I am proud to be a kind and generous friend.
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q What are you most ashamed of?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A The way I always wear my heart on my sleeve. I have been trying to develop a poker face for work and love for years, though none has surfaced yet.
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q What motivates you?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A Love and learning.
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q If you were diagnosed with a terminal disease today, what would you do?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A I’m going to assume that the worst hasn’t set in yet and I’m functional as a person at this early stage in diagnosis. As such, I would sign up for as many credit cards as possible and max them out traveling around the world. 
            I’d aim to go to the most politically corrupt or war torn locales (assuming I could somehow get a visa or get past boarder patrol). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't worry, I’m not arrogant enough to think that my spoiled American self can help by being there. My life has been privileged beyond reason, so if I’m going to die in the near to medium term, I’d be in a rush to experience and understand what it’s like to live in these places I’ve only ever read about. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I’d also call my family and friends often to express gratitude and love, but I do that anyway. Oh, and if the opportunity presented itself to shoot heroin toward the very end of my road, I’d be so in. The one thing I wouldn’t do is endure whatever treatment prolongs my life but confines my existence to hospital rooms and drug dependence.
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q What are you afraid of?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A Of myself if I let lonely or miserable thoughts take over for too long. I’m not afraid of death, but I am afraid of winding up alone in a nursing home. Call back to the last question I would sooner OD on heroin than go that route.
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q If you could have any career and be guaranteed to make a comfortable living, what would it be?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A When I’m older, I’d like run a bed and breakfast somewhere tropical and seaside. For now, if I had any idea, then that’s what I’d be doing.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Note:</em> I wrote this interview with my myself for a creative writing class in the winter of 2015. It's now nearly summer of the same year and I'm heading full-on towards a path I'm excited about. If you're reading this, you can probably guess what it is.
        </p>

        <p class = "Q">
            Q Last question are you happy?
        </p>

        <p class = "A">
            A This is a ridiculous question! Everything in life is impermanent. Everything. Happiness isn’t some token that you collect and then you have it, it ebbs and flows. That said, I consider myself a generally happy person known to have stubborn streaks of misery. I hope I’ve given you enough to work with today. I hope you’re happy.
        </p>
